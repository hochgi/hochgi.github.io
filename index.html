  <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is it for?</h2>
  <p>
    To easily have unique strong passwords for different services.
  </p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Why?</h3>
  <p>
    We shouldn't reuse the same password in different services.
    There's too many breaches, and too many shady services storing your password in plain text.
    You can check if any of your passwords has been pwned <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">here</a>.
    If one reuses their password, a hacker can (and will) easily use that password to log into more sensitive services (e.g. your bank account).
  </p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">How?</h3>
  <p>
    OK, so a different password per service…
    <br>
    but how can one keep track of all their different passwords?
  </p>
  <p>
    You could rely on external password management services like
     <a href="https://1password.com/">1password</a>, 
     <a href="https://nordpass.com/">nordpass</a>, 
     <a href="https://lastpass.com/">lastpass</a>, etc'…
  </p>
  <p>
    But…
    <br>
    If you don't like to rely on a 3rd party services to always be available whenever you need it (no service has 100% uptime), 
    or prefer not to pay for it, or just too paranoid to trust it, then you can rely on a password generator instead of a password manager.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a password generator, you can have one master password, which you never use directly - but be able to generate different passwords for different services with it.
  </p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">What exactly is a "password generator"?</h3>
  <p>A password generator is a small program you run <b>locally</b> without anything communicated to any 3rd party service.</p>
  <p>
    to verify this little web app does not communicate anything to the outside world, you can open the developers tools' network tab, 
    and see no requests are being made when the form is filled or submitted.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>TL;DR:</b><br> we just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hash</a> all inputs together: <pre style="text-align: center;">hash($username ++ $service ++ $master_password)</pre>
    Meaning, for different usernames, and different services, even the same password yields a different unique password.
  </p>
  <p>
    Originally, I created a simple bash script to do that, which worked great, but was not really useable from non-pc machines like mobile phones.
    That's why I created this little page, allowing for simple password generation "everywhere".
  </p>
  <p>
    You can freely copy the original bash script to use if you want:
  </p>
  <div>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/hochgi/afe3b6a2ae604e85590a3729e25efd33/00f8d8806449f195f9439ce2d40bbbbc32c1081a.js"></script>
  </div>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Use responsibly</h3>
  <p>
    Good passwords should have enough bits of entropy, as we can learn from <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">this xkcd oldie</a>:
  </p>
  <img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png"/>
  <p>
    This is especially true when choosing a master password for a password generator.
    Brute force attacks against services are often mitigated by rate limiting, and limited attempts.
    But a simple hach function which anyone can run locally is prone to brute force attacks.
    If an attacker get's hold of one of your unique hashed passwords, and guesses you might be using this password generator,
    they can easily brute force known/short passwords, and if unfourtunately you use such a password, 
    they now get match against hash, and infer your master password.
    <br>
    If that happens, they can now use same generator to generate passwords to more sensitive services you might be using.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, if you're considering a dumb easily type-able password to use as your master password, I have one thing to say to you:

    // Populate hash algorithm options
    const algorithms = ["SHA-1", "SHA-256", "SHA-384", "SHA-512"]; // add any desired algorithms here
    const algorithmSelect = document.getElementById('algorithm');
    algorithms.forEach(algo => {
      const option = document.createElement('option');
      option.value = algo;
      option.textContent = algo;
      algorithmSelect.appendChild(option);
    });
    
    async function generatePassword(event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      
      // Collect form inputs
      const user = document.getElementById('username').value;
      const service = document.getElementById('service').value;
      const password = document.getElementById('password').value;
      const algorithm = document.getElementById('algorithm').value;
      const combinedString = `${user}:${password}@${service}`;
      
      // Encode combinedString to a Uint8Array
      const encoder = new TextEncoder();
      const data = encoder.encode(combinedString);
      
      // Hash the combined data
      const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest(algorithm, data);
      
      // Convert hash to hex
      const hashArray = Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer));
      const hashHex = hashArray.map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
      
      // Convert to base64 format for password
      const base64String = btoa(hashHex.match(/.{1,2}/g).map(byte => String.fromCharCode(parseInt(byte, 16))).join(''));
      const transformedPassword = base64String.replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/=/g, '');
      
      // Show first few characters as a hint and copy full password to clipboard
      const visiblePart = transformedPassword.slice(0, 5) + '...';
      document.getElementById('result').textContent = `Generated Password: ${visiblePart} (copied to clipboard)`;
      
      // Copy to clipboard
      navigator.clipboard.writeText(transformedPassword)

        .catch(err => console.error('Failed to copy password to clipboard', err));
    }
